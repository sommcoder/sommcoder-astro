.carousel-section {
  display: grid;
  margin: 5rem 0rem;

/*
min needs to be large enough to accommodate the px of the img tags in CarouselItem


Mobile users should just be able to scroll down through the projects, but Desktop users will have arrows and a proper Carousel setup to scroll through the CarouselItems

We will have to wrap the grid code above in a media query to show what we need for Desktop Users.

min-width is a mobile first approach!!
@media (min-width: 500px) {
}

we need to have the carousel items appear as if they are cycling through the page
